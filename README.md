**Synopsis**
The final hour of the popular virtual reality game Yggdrasil has come. However, Momonga, a powerful wizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in the game as the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight, Momonga is still fully conscious as his character and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to have developed personalities of their own! Confronted with this abnormal situation, Momonga commands his loyal servants to help him investigate and take control of this new world, with the hopes of figuring out what has caused this development and if there may be others in the same predicament.

**Personal Experience**
While watching this ==God Tier== of an anime series, every time I pressed the next episode button I was in for a treat ðŸ˜‚ of course I would like to add that I am not someone who is willing to wait for a new episode to pop up every week ðŸ˜‘, that being said this was one of my early childhood animes that really hits deep. It has been a long time since it actually received another season and that in itself fills me with anticipation because even after 4 seasons, the old questions that I have been asking are still lingering and whats even more shocking is that its been so long yet I still long for these questions to be answered ðŸ˜¥, if you wish to watch this I wish that you have the same experience and mind blowing imagination that I went through ðŸ¤¯.
